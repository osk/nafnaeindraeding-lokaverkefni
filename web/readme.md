# Display of relational data

Bare bones implemention of Sigma + Graphology site that shows the relational data. Switch out imported data in `./src/main.ts`, weak relations take forever to load.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# or
npm run build
# serve ./dist on a server, e.g.
cd dist
python -m http.server 8000
```
